Extension.ts Code (COMMENTED OUT):\n- **FileProcessor Module**: All references to `./fileProcessor` module are commented out\n- **Command Registration**: Currently only registers a placeholder `doThing` command\n- **Sort Command Handler**: `handleSortCommand` function renamed to `handleDoThingCommand` but still contains property sorting logic in comments\n- **Configuration Access**: Commented out code for reading property sorting configuration\n- **File Pattern Filtering**: Commented out logic for file pattern matching\n\n### 3. Missing Files:\n- **No FileProcessor Module**: The `./fileProcessor` module referenced in comments doesn't exist\n- **No Property Sorting Implementation**: Only placeholder/commented code exists\n\n### 4. Documentation:\n- **README.md**: Still describes property sorting functionality extensively\n- **Package Description**: Still mentions \"property sorting\" in the description\n\n**Status**: The extension appears to be in a transition state where most property sorting code has been commented out but the package.json configuration and documentation still reference the old functionality.
